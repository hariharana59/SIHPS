E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea

The E-Waste Facility Locator aims to provide a platform for users to easily find nearby facilities where they can responsibly dispose of their electronic waste (e-waste). The platform will help raise awareness about the importance of e-waste recycling and make it convenient for people to recycle their old electronics.

The solution involves creating a web or mobile application that allows users to enter their location or enable geolocation services to find the nearest e-waste recycling facilities. The application can also provide information such as the types of electronics accepted, operating hours, contact information, and any special instructions for recycling.


## Use Cases

1.User Search: Users can search for e-waste facilities by entering their location or using geolocation.

2.Facility Details: Users can view details about each facility, such as address, contact information, accepted items, and operating hours.

3.Navigation: Users can get directions to the selected facility from their current location.

4.Contribution: Facilities can update their information and provide feedback to improve the platform.

5.Awareness: The platform can provide tips and information on e-waste recycling to raise awareness.
